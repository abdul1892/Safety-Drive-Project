# SafeDriveVision

## Project Description
SafeDriveVision is a computer vision project aimed at enhancing road safety. This project leverages deep learning models to detect and alert in real-time the dangerous behaviors of drivers, such as using a phone while driving or showing signs of drowsiness. The primary goal is to help reduce road accidents by alerting drivers to their potentially hazardous actions.

## Features
- **Phone Use Detection**: Utilizes the YOLOv5 model to identify drivers using their phones during driving.
- **Drowsiness Detection**: Incorporates a custom detector (sharp detector) to monitor signs of driver fatigue.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Implements an alert system that warns the driver when a risky behavior is detected.


## Requierments

- PyTorch >= 0.4.1 (PyTorch v1.1.0 is tested successfully.)

- Python >= 3.6 (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib)

- Dlib 
- OpenCV (Python version, for image IO operations.)
- Cython (For accelerating depth and PNCC render.)
